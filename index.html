                <h3>Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/computational-visualization-center/">Computational Visualization Center</a></h3>
                <h5>The University of Texas at Austin - Austin, TX</h5>
                <h5>May 2020 to August 2021</h5>
                <p>Chase worked with many students to help turn their theoretical 
                    algorithms into runnable code. He also worked closely with 
                    the Texas Advanced Computing Center to run larger jobs on 
                    their massive computers.</p>

                <p>Chase built the website you are on now (writing these things in third-person is pretty weird). He built it all from scratch using HTML5 and it is still a work in progress. Future updates are detailed in the following project entries.</p>
                <p>Source code available <a href="https://github.com/chasetessmer/chasetessmer.github.io">HERE</a>.</p>

                <p>I plan to use javascript and SQL to create a custom API that will allow visitors to my website to write and search for reviews of yours truly.</p>
