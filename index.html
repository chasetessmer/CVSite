                            <h4>Python</h4>
                            <div>
                                <p>I've been writing and reviewing Python code since 2018.
                                    My experience in Python mostly revolves around manipulating databases
                                    with modules like pandas and machine learning.
                                </p>

                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    PyTorch is the machine learning module I am most familiar with.
                                    I also have a good amount of experience with Keras and a bit less with
                                    Tensorflow.
                                </p>

                                    I managed my lab's GitHub organization when I was working as a
                                    graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin.
                                </p>

                                    I have experience using software engineering best practices such as code coverage,
                                    linters, Git, and unit testing.

                        <p>I worked with many students to help turn their theoretical 
                            algorithms into runnable code. I also worked closely with 
                            the Texas Advanced Computing Center to run larger jobs on 
                            their massive computers.</p>
